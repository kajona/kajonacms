Module JQPlot

V4.7 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_jqplot -> padding and margin of bars within barcharts are differently set depending on the number of series - if the chart contains only bar chart series -> padding=1, margin=4 - if the chart contains one or more stackedbar series and each sereis has exactly one series value -> padding=1, margin=4

V4.6 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: module_jqplot | resizable charts -> charts are now resizable by default
NEW: module_jqplot | js-code -> extracted generated js-Code to several methods
NEW: module_jqplot | animated charts-> charts are now animated when being rendered
NEW: module_jqplot | renderer -> added support for highdpi displays (e.g. retina). this fix is not officially released by the jqplot team, so only a temporary solution
UPDATE: module_jqplot | bar chart -> added new method setHorizontalBar to enable horizontal bar chart rendering
BUG: module_jqplot | invisible Axis -> added methods with which it is possible to set xAxis labels invisible
BUG: module_jqplot | point labels -> point labels are now rendered in white color

V4.4 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: plugin canvasOverlay is now included, added setter and getter for the series options

V4.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: new charting-library, replacing flot completely
